# üá¨üáß üá´üá∑  Hello there! üëã I'm Naomi.

I'm a junior JavaScript front-end web developer currently based in France, who aspires to thrive in web development by building solo projects and showing what I'm capable of.

I mainly use JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS and Angular for front-end projects, but have already experienced some back-end development with Node.js, NestJS, Express and PostgreSQL.

I learned web development through a French online school called [O'Clock](https://oclock.io) in which I spent 6 months from February 2021 to August 2021. Thanks to O'Clock, I learned all the different assets of FullStack development and I am no stranger to real life work environments.

I then took some time off to practice all the notions I had heard about before starting to create small projects.

In October 2022 I enrolled in a 3 month web development course so as to learn Angular, TypeScript, NestJS and Docker. I then started working as a Front-end web developer for a French company.

üíº Today, I am more than ever ready to continue working in a team of passionate developers, in order to learn from them and develop my skills. 

## My latest projects
- üéµ [**Museek 2023**](https://github.com/naomi-lgt/Museek-2023): a project powered by the Genius website API and an Express server in order to find music lyrics.
- üßë‚Äçüç≥ [**Villa Rosa**](https://github.com/naomi-lgt/villa-rosa): a one page showcase website for a mock restaurant, made with React.

## Currently working on
- üéß [**Spotify 98**](https://github.com/naomi-lgt/spotify-98): a Spotify clone made with React, Node.js and inspired by the UI of Windows 98.
- üíú [**Meeet**](https://github.com/naomi-lgt/meeet-react-js): a dating website based on geolocation made with React, React Redux and with Google Firebase.

...and many more to come!
